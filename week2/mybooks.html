			<p>Ah, reading. If you are anything like me, you've started putting together a list of books to read this summer (the spring list is bursting at the seams). If you are even more like me, you've probably already spent a not-so-insignificant chunk of your monthly food budget on reading material. While there is no shortage of interesting and intriguing books to crack open on the weekends, there is also something to be said for coming back to an old favorite &#8212 certain characters and storylines draw you in both on your first and thirty-first encounter. I thought I'd put together a list of some of the works that keep me coming back again and again: whether that be in the realm of classics, historical novels, adventure stores, non-fiction or biographies. Have your own stories that you keep coming back to again and again? Drop me a line with some of your recommendations!</p>

			<p> <strong> Master & Margarita </strong> </li>
		<p> <strong> Mikhail Bulgakov </strong> </p>
		<img src="Images/masterandmargarita.jpeg" class="b" /> 
		<p> &#34;Who told you that there is no true, faithful, eternal love in this world! May the liar&#8217;s vile tongue be cut out!&#34; A classic of Russian literature, <i>Master and Margarita</i> is at once a political satire of the supposedly egalitarian society created in the Soviet Union and a simple love story between two people who, according to all logic, should never have been together. Through a storyline that is both fantastical and utterly believable, the book draws you in and doesn't let go in the way so few stories do.
