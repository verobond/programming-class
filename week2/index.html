	<h1> <center> My Favorite Books </center>  </h1>

	<h4> <center> By: Veronika Bondarenko </center> </h4>
 
	
	<p> Ah, reading. If you are anything like me, you've started putting together a list of books to read this summer (the spring list is bursting at the seams). If you are even more like me, you've probably already spent a not-so-insignificant chunk of your monthly food budget on reading material. While there is no shortage of interesting and intriguing books to crack open on the weekends, there is also something to be said for coming back to an old favorite&#8212;certain characters and storylines draw you in both on your first and thirty-first encounter. I thought I'd put together a list of some of the works that keep me coming back again and again: whether that be in the realm of classics, historical novels, adventure stores, non-fiction or biographies. Have your own stories that you keep coming back to again and again? Drop me a line with some of your recommendations! </p>

 	<ul>
		<li> <strong> A Tree Grows in Brooklyn </strong> </li>
		<p> <strong> Betty Smith </strong> <p>
			<img src="Images/treegrowsinbrooklyn.jpg" /> 
		<p>A classic coming-of-age novel about a young girl who grows up in Williamsburg at the turn of the century, <i> A Tree Grows in Brooklyn </i> will draw you in with the resilience of its characters, who continue to strive for better days even in the face of crushing poverty. </p>

		<li> <strong> In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto </strong> </li>
		<p> <strong> Michael Pollan </strong> </p>
		<img src="Images/indefenseoffood.jpg" /> 
		<p> Popular journalist and food activist Michael Pollan proposes the controversial idea that the products that most of us rely on for our diet are neither food nor edible. If you are interested in healthy eating in the modern world, <i> In Defense of Food </i>  will at once shock you, disgust you and push you to do better. </p>

		<li> <strong> Master & Margarita </strong> </li>
		<p> <strong> Mikhail Bulgakov </strong> </p>
		<img src="Images/masterandmargarita.jpeg" /> 
		<p> &#34;Who told you that there is no true, faithful, eternal love in this world! May the liar&#8217;s vile tongue be cut out!&#34; A classic of Russian literature, <i>Master and Margarita</i> is at once a political satire of the supposedly egalitarian society created in the Soviet Union and a simple love story between two people who, according to all logic, should never have been together. Through a storyline that is both fantastical and utterly believable, the book draws you in and doesn't let go in the way so few stories do.

		<li> <strong> The Sun Also Rises </strong> </li>
		<p><strong> Ernest Hemingway </strong> </p>
	
		<img src="Images/sunalsorises.jpeg" />	
		<p>This is a quintessential travel novel (the story follows a set of characters as they travel from Paris to Pamplona to watch a bullfight) and is my favourite Hemingway novel. At once about aimlessness, the desire for excitement and the inability to put one's true feelings into words, this book will resonate with anyone who has ever felt lost and dissatisfied and alone.  </p>

		<li> <strong> The Gospel According to Coco Chanel: Life Lessons From The World's Most Elegant Woman </strong>  </li>
		<p> <strong> Karen Karbo </strong> </p> 
		<img src="Images/cocochanel.jpg" /> 
		<p> This book is a must for anyone who is interested in fashion or Coco Chanel or Parisian history. Presenting the details of Chanel's life with a fair dose of humor, <i>The Gospel According to Coco Chanel</i> continues to resonate with women living in the twenty-first century and, in that, is unlike all the other biographies that have already been written about the fashion icons. </p>
